<h2 class="cl-heading">COVER LETTER</h2>
<p>Dear Hiring Manager,<br><br>
FREENOW is a company that has consistently captured my attention throughout my academic and professional journey. In my dissertation thesis, where I meticulously analyzed over 100,000 startups in a quantitative manner, I couldn't help but notice the significant impact of companies like FREENOW in the mobility sector. It is this profound understanding and admiration for FREENOW's role in shaping the industry that has fueled my desire to join your esteemed team.<br><br>
Through my dissertation research, I delved deep into the analysis of evolving business models and value propositions of startups, seeking to understand the intricacies of their success or failure. Whenever FREENOW (respectively mytaxi) appeared in my data, I was captivated by the innovation and resilience exhibited by the company, which further solidified my aspiration to contribute to its mission. Today, I am eager to turn this aspiration into reality by bringing my expertise and passion to the Data Enablement team at FREENOW.<br><br>
My proficiency in translating business requirements into effective data solutions, combined with my expertise in quantitative analysis, data-driven decision-making, adeptness with data visualization tools and dedication to empowering end-users, perfectly align with the expectations outlined for the BI Developer role. I am confident that my unique perspective gained from analyzing diverse startup ecosystems will bring valuable insights to FREENOW's data initiatives. I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to FREENOW's continued success and innovation in the mobility sector.<br><br>
Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the possibility of discussing how my academic background and professional experiences align with FREENOW's goals in more detail.
<br><br><br><br>
Warm regards,<br><br><br>
Joschka Schwarz
