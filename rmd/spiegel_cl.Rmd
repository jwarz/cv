Dear Hiring Manager,

Disclaimer: While I may **not possess direct experience with the Adobe Experience Stack**, I have a solid understanding of fundamental concepts such as Web Analytics, Personalization, and Data Collection, and how they intersect. I am enthusiastic about learning and integrating these principles within your AEM or any other application. I am particularly interested in gaining hands-on experience observing end-to-end data flow and leveraging segmentation for personalized customer experiences. Additionally, I am keen on utilizing various services within the AEP to construct real-time customer profiles. I am eager to contribute to your team and grow professionally in this domain.

As I am currently finishing my Ph.D. in English, I am also writing to you in English. In the final stages of completing my doctoral dissertation, I have honed my skills in transforming intricate data sets into meaningful insights. My research has equipped me with a deep understanding of complex patterns, allowing me to provide concise explanations and visualizations. I am excited about the prospect of applying these skills to contribute to the exceptional journalism and data-driven insights that SPIEGEL is known for. As a candidate with a strong background in quantitative research and data analysis, I am eager to bring my expertise to your esteemed organization.

Throughout my academic journey and my practical experiences, I have collaborated with diverse teams, demonstrating my ability to work independently and take ownership of projects. With a Master's degree in Business Administration and Engineering and over five years of relevant professional experience (Research Associate), I am confident that my skills and expertise will enable me to excel in this role. Designing and teaching multiple Data Science and Entrepreneurship related classes gives me not only a broad understanding and up to date expertise of different data architectures but also how they might relate to your global digital presence. 

Additionally, I have strong programming skills and a general software engineering know-how. I am particularly intrigued by the opportunity to work with SPIEGEL's tech stack. While my expertise lies in SQL and R, I am confident in my ability to quickly adapt and learn new tools, aligning with your emphasis on a team-oriented approach and deriving business-relevant knowledge from data.

As I approach the completion of my Ph.D., I am excited about the prospect of joining the SPIEGEL group and contributing to the continuous improvement of your data platform. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss further how my quantitative research background and analytical skills align with the needs of your dynamic team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the possibility of an interview.

Sincerely,

Joschka Schwarz
